# HCL Connections and Component Pack Deployment Automation Framework

The goal of the HCL Connections and Component Pack Deployment Automation Framework is to provide a solid foundation that can be readily adapted and customized to suit a customerâ€™s unique Connections deployment requirements. This framework is used by the Connections team for internal deployments and can be used as an accelerator to reduce the overhead of deploying a connections environment.

Connections development is committed to ensuring its ongoing maintenance and periodic updates of this repository, which are typically synchronized with each new CR release.  Additionally, we aim to maintain a consistent review schedule for pull requests (PRs) in alignment with these update cycles.

Before you start, please be sure to check out [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/connections-automation/blob/main/documentation/FAQ.md).

For HCL Connections 8 dependencies this means that:

* Database will be installed (IBM DB2, Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server), configured as per Performance tunning guide for HCL Connections, and license applied. Please note: the license, the same one from FlexNet, will be applied only to IBM DB2 v11.5. If you want to learn more about using HCL Connections with different database backends, please [check out this document](https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/connections-automation/blob/main/documentation/howtos/setup_connections_with_different_database_backends.md).
* HCL Connections Wizard will populate the database with needed schemas and grants.
* If needed for demo or even production purposes, OpenLDAP will be spun up and seeded with some demo users. OpenLDAP will be spun up with SSL enabled, as needed later for setting up IBM WebSphere Application Server properly.
* IBM TDI will be installed, configured, and run to populate profiles database in IBM DB2 with users from OpenLDAP
* IBM Installation Manager will be set up on the nodes where IBM WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment needs to be installed.
* IBM WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment will be set up where needed. Currently we tested it with Fixpack 23. By default, FP23 is going to be installed. Deployment manager and nodeagents profiles are going to be created, application security enabled, TLS certificated imported from LDAP, LDAP configured up to the point where it is ready to install HCL Connections 8.
* IBM HTTP Server is going to be installed, patched with the same fixpack as IBM WebSphere Application Server, and added to the deployment manager.
* NFS server will be installed, including master and clients configurations and proper folders set.

For HCL Connections 8 itself it means:

* The script will mount NFS shares needed for the shared data and message stores where needed.
* Install and configure database (currently IBM DB2 and Oracle are supported)
* HCL Connections 8 will be downloaded and installed. Any type of layout is supported and customizable.
* In LotusConnections-config.xml dynamicHost will be updated.
* Optionaly, Prometheus JMX exported will be enabled for all HCL Connections clusters.
* Moderation will be installed and optionally it can be enabled as well.
* In case of upgrades, it will clean up temp folders to prevent possible issues with UI post upgrade.
* All or some (or none) clusters will be started automatically.
* IBM HTTP Server plugins will get generated and propagated
* IBM HTTP Server's httpd.conf will be generated ready to support Component Pack integrations.
* Needed post installation tasks on IBM WebSphere Application Server, like setting up properly session management and single sign on will be also handled.

For Component Pack for HCL Connections 8 it means:

* Nginx will be set up and configured to support Customizer.
* Haproxy will be set up configured to be the control plane for Kubernetes cluster and Component Pack.
* NFS will be set up for Component Pack.
* Containerd(container runtime) v1.4.12 will be installed with the optimisations required by the version of Kubernetes.
* Kubernetes 1.27.0 will be set up.
* Component Pack will be set up by default using latest community Kubernetes Ingress, Grafana and Prometheus for monitoring out of the box.
* Post installation tasks needed for configuring Component Pack and the WebSphere-side of Connections to work together are also going to be executed, including enabling searches and Metrics using OpenSearch.

## Requirements:

* Ansible 2.9 installed on your machine
* SSH access (passwordless makes stuff easier, but not mandatory) to the machine(s) you want to provision. Be sure that key forwarding is properly set on your controller and on all machines that you plan to manage with.
* Your user (or any user used for the purposes of provisioning) having passwordless sudo acces on the nodes being provisioned.

To learn more about how to install Ansible on your local machine or Ansible controller, please check out [official Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).

Supported OSs:

* CentOS 7+
* RHEL 9

NOTE: Recommended OS for this automation is CentOS 7.9/RHEL 9. All HCL Connections, Docs and Component Pack builds are done on CentOS 7.9/RHEL 9. While it is being tested, in different scenarios, using version 8+ on CentOS you may hit different issues that are eventually not being tested.

### Have files ready for download

To be able to use this automation you will need to be able to download the packages.

The suggestion is to have them all downloaded in a single location, and for this you would need at least 50G of disk space. Run a small HTTP server just to be able to serve them, it can be as simple as a single Ruby one liner to open web server on specific port so that automation can connect and download it.

#### Note: There is a known issue in IBM WebSphere 8.5.5 Fixpack 22 where retrieve from port using TLS v1.3 or v1.2 ciphers may not work. See [PH49497: RETRIEVE FROM PORT NOT HONORING SSL PROTOCOL](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/apar/PH49497) for details.  The problem is fixed in Fixpack 23.  If Fixpack 22 is needed, contact HCL Connections support or IBM WebSphere support for the iFix 8.5.5.22-WS-WAS-IFPH49497.zip and put it in the was855FP22 directory as the example below.
This is the example data folder structure we are following at HCL.  Please refer to FlexNet when verifying the size and timestamps of the packages.

```

Of course, you can drop it all to a single folder, or restructure it whatever way you prefer.

### Inventory files

Inventory files live in environments folder. To keep things simple, there are two files (you can break it to more if you want, it's up to you):
* inventory.ini which has all FQDNs of the hosts in different groups
* group_vars/all.yml with the variables you can customize.

We strongly recommend using the current model for handling variables. However, if you still want to stick with the old model, the only thing you need to add is cnx_was_servers group to your old connections inventory file. Otherwise, it is backwards compatible.

### SSH User

If you run the Ansible playbooks from a Mac or Linux host, you need to specify the `remote_user` for the SSH connection, or it will default to your local username.

Edit `ansible.cfg` and remove the comment `#` from the line and set your user:

    # remote_user = root

Example:

    remote_user = sysadmin

The `ansible.cfg` allows a lot of settings, see the example file at https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/examples/ansible.cfg and it can stay in the root of your Ansible project, or can be placed in `~/.ansible.cfg`, then it will work for all of your Ansible projects.

### Supported layouts

Those scripts should be able to support both single node installations and HA environments, specifically:

* We tested with a single WAS node (DMGR, IHS, and Node agent co-located)
* We tested with a proper distributed WAS (two separate WAS nodes, two separate IHSs behind internal load balancer, DMGR on a dedicated machine)
* Kubernetes can be single node installation or any type of HA. Scaling is also supported by those scripts (you can add new masters or workers if you created your Kubernetes environment using those scripts in the first place).

### Cache folders

Running those scripts specifically for Component Pack will create two cache folders:

* /tmp/k8s_cache and
* /home/${YOURUSER}/generated_charts

The second one will have all the values generated when running Helm installs. Those value files are used by Helm to install Component Pack. Values you see inside are coming from a variables inside your automation.

## Setting up HCL Connections with its dependencies

This scenario is useful in multiple cases:
* If you want to spin up a demo environment where you want to be able to quickly log in and start using it
* If you want to spin up a production ready environment that you know will work, see it work, and then start replacing component by component (like switching/adding LDAP servers, switching databases, etc).

```
ansible-playbook -i environments/examples/cnx8/db2/inventory.ini playbooks/setup-connections-complete.yml
```

Running this playbook will:
* Setup database (IBM DB2 or Oracle) with HCL Connections Wizards on top
* Install OpenLDAP and populate it with a number of fake user, one of them being the HCL Connections admin user
* Set and execute IBM TDI to popule PeopleDB with LDAP users
* Install IBM WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment and IBM HTTP Server and configure it properly
* Install HCL Connections on top of that

You can, of course, run those steps separately.

### Setting up IBM DB2

To install JDBC drivers for DB2 on WAS nodes for example, please set:

```
setup_db2_jdbc: True
```

To install IBM DB2 only, execute:

```
ansible-playbook -i environments/examples/cnx8/db2/inventory.ini playbooks/third_party/setup-db2.yml
```

This will install IBM DB2 on a Linux server, tune the server and IBM DB2 as per Performance tunning guide for HCL Connections, and apply the licence.

In case IBM DB2 was already installed nothing will happen, the scripts will just ensure that everything is as expected. JDBC drivers will be only installed if the variable mentioned above is also set.

### Setting up Oracle database

To install JDBC drivers for Oracle on WAS nodes for example, please set:

```
setup_oracle_jdbc: True
```

To install Oracle 19c only, execute:

```
ansible-playbook -i environments/examples/cnx8/oracle/inventory.ini playbooks/third_party/setup-oracle.yml
```

Running this playbook will set up the prerequisites for Oracle 19c (like setting up big enough swap on the node dedicated for Oracle database) but it will also set up the JDBC for HCL Connections and HCL Connections Docs.

JDBC drivers for Oracle will be only installed if you have setup_oracle_jdbc set to true as mentioned above.

### Installing HCL Connections Wizards

This requires the database already being set. To create the databases and apply the grants, execute:

```
ansible-playbook -i environments/examples/cnx8/db2/inventory.ini playbooks/hcl/setup-connections-wizards.yml
```

If databases already exist, this script will execute runstats and rerogs on all the databases by default on each consecutive run.

If you want to recreate the databases, uncomment:

```
#cnx_force_repopulation: True
```

If you want to run database migration scripts, uncomment:

```
#db_enable_upgrades: True
```

in your inventory file. This will then drop all the databases and recreate them again. Don't forget to run TDI afterwards. Be sure to comment it again once you do it.

### Setting up OpenLDAP with SSL and amount of fake users

To install OpenLDAP with SSL enabled and generate fake users, execute:

```
ansible-playbook -i environments/examples/cnx8/db2/inventory.ini playbooks/third_party/setup-ldap.yml
```

You can turn on or off creating any of fake users by manipulating:

```
setup_fake_ldap_users: True
```

If you are creating them, you can manipulate the details using next set of variables:

```
ldap_nr_of_users: 2500
ldap_userid: "fakeuser"
ldap_user_password: "password"
ldap_user_admin_password: "password"
```

This will create 2500 fake accounts, starting with user id 'fakeuser1' and going to 'fakeuser2499'. First of them in this case (fakeuser1) will get 'ldap_user_admin_password' set, and all others are going to get 'ldap_user_password'. On top of that, it you will get automatically 10 more users created being set as external. Be sure to set in this case one of those users as HCL Connections admin user before the Connections installation like here:

```
connections_admin: fakeuser1
ldap_user_mail_domain: "connections.example.com"
```

This comes in handy if you don't have any other LDAP server ready and you want to quickly get to the point where you can test HCL Connections. You can later replace this LDAP with any other one.

### Setting up IBM TDI and populating PeopleDB

To install IBM TDI, set up tdisol folder as per documentation, and migrate the users from LDAP to IBM DB2, run:

```
ansible-playbook -i environments/examples/cnx8/db2/inventory.ini playbooks/third_party/setup-tdi.yml
```

### Installing and configuring IBM WebSphere Application Server only

To install IBM WebSphere Application Server, you should alraedy have either LDAP installed all LDAP data properly configured in your inventory file, in the section like this:

```
# This is just an example!
ldap_server: ldap1.internal.example.com
ldap_alias: ldap1
ldap_repo: LDAP_PRODUCTION1
ldap_bind_user: cn=Admin,dc=cxn,dc=example,dc=com
ldap_bind_pass: password
ldap_realm: dc=cxn,dc=example,dc=com
ldap_login_properties: uid;mail
```

LDAP should also have SSL enabled as IBM WebSphere Application Server is going to try to import its TLS certificate and fail if there is none.

And in the end, you need to create WebSphere user account by setting this:

```
was_username=wasadmin
was_password=password
```

To install JDBC drivers for Oracle, please set:

```
setup_oracle_jdbc: True
```

To install IBM WebSphere Application Server, IBM HTTP Server and configure it, execute:

```
ansible-playbook -i environments/examples/cnx8/db2/inventory.ini playbooks/third_party/setup-webspherend.yml
```

### Preparing NFS for HCL Connections

By default, HCL Connections would use NFS for message stores and shared data. In case of single node and small demo environments, NFS is not needed, and that is also supported.

If you are going to use NFS with HCL Connections, then set it up first before you proceed with HCL Connections installation with:

```
ansible-playbook -i environments/examples/cnx8/db2/inventory.ini playbooks/third_party/setup-nfs.yml
```

### Installing HCL Connections

By default, use of NFS is enabled, which means HCL Connections would try to mount the folders for shared data and message store. Note that NFS is needed if you plan to install HCL Docs later on a separate server.  If you don't want it to be mounted and don't plan to install HCL Docs on a separate server, set:

```
skip_nfs_mount_for_connections: true
```

To install the WebSphere-side of HCL Connections only, on an already prepared environment (all previous steps are already done and the environment is ready for HCL Connections to be installed) execute:

```
ansible-playbook -i environments/examples/cnx8/db2/inventory.ini playbooks/hcl/setup-connections-only.yml
```

Note that installation will not start (and will inform you about that) if mandatory variables are missing.

To enable Moderation and Invites, set:

```
cnx_enable_moderation: true
cnx_enable_invite: true
```

To ensure that you don't have to pin specific offering version yourself, make sure that the next variable is set:

```
cnx_updates_enabled: True
```

You can also rewrite locations of message and shared data stores by manipulating next two variables before you hit install:

```
cnx_shared_area: "/nfs/data/shared"
cnx_message_store: "/nfs/data/messageStores"
```

### Installing cFix for HCL Connections

To install iFix on already installed HCL Connections, edit your connections inventory file, and append these two lines:

```
ifix_apar:                                       CFix.XX.XXXX
ifix_file:                                       CFix.XX.XXXX-ICX.X.X.X-Common-Fix.jar
cnx_ifix_installer:                              "updateInstaller_XXXX.zip"
```

After it, run the iFix installation:

```
ansible-playbook -i environments/examples/cnx8/db2/inventory.ini playbooks/hcl/setup-connections-ifix.yml
```

### Running post installation tasks

If you don't plan on installing the Component Pack and `cnx_application_ingress` is set to a host that can access the Connections server frontend (eg. IHS) via a browser now, run this playbook to set up some post installation bits and pieces to make the Connections deployment accessible.  Otherwise, continue to the Component Pack deployment before testing the deployment.

```
ansible-playbook -i environments/examples/cnx8/db2/inventory.ini playbooks/hcl/connections-post-install.yml
```

## Setting up Component Pack for HCL Connections 8 with its dependencies

To set up Component Pack, you should have the WebSphere-side of Connections already up and running and be able to log in successfully.

Follow the steps in [Installing MongoDB 5 for Component Pack](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/connections-doc/admin/install/installing_mongodb_5_for_component_pack_8.html) till the point the image is imported into containerd. This is a manual step.

Access to the HCL Harbor registry is needed to install the Component Pack. You can provide the Harbor credentials (and Quay credentials if enabling Huddo Boards) as environment variables.

```
export HARBOR_USERNAME=<<Harbor username>>
export HARBOR_SECRET=<<Harbor password>>

export QUAY_USERNAME=<<Quay username>>
export QUAY_SECRET=<<Quay password>>
```

Then add Harbor variables to the inventory files as below

```
component_pack_helm_repository:                  https://hclcr.io/chartrepo/cnx
docker_registry_url:                             hclcr.io/cnx
docker_registry_username:                        "{{ lookup('env','HARBOR_USERNAME') }}"
docker_registry_password:                        "{{ lookup('env','HARBOR_SECRET') }}"
```

Then execute:

```
ansible-playbook -i environments/examples/cnx8/db2/inventory.ini playbooks/setup-component-pack-complete-harbor.yml
```

This playbook will:

* Set up Nginx
* Set up Haproxy
* Set up NFS
* Set up containerd (container runtime)
* Set up Kubernetes
* Install and configure Component Pack to work with Connections

By default, Component Pack will consider first node in [nfs_servers] to be your NFS master also, and by default it will consider that on NFS master, all needed folders for Component Pack live in /pv-connections. You can rewrite it with:

```
nfsMasterAddress: "172.29.31.1"
persistentVolumePath: "nfs"
```

This translates to //172.29.31.1:/nfs

Note: The Component Pack installation and configuration contains tasks with an impact on the WebSphere-side of Connections side which require restarts of WebSphere and Connections itself, and which will be executed.

### Setting up Nginx

Nginx is used only as an example of a reverse proxy for the WebSphere-side of Connections and Component Pack.

To install Nginx only, execute:

```
ansible-playbook -i environments/examples/cnx8/db2/inventory.ini playbooks/third_party/setup-nginx.yml
```

### Setting up Haproxy

Haproxy is used as an example load balancer. To ensure it is not trying to bind to the same ports as Nginx, by default, it is going to use non standard ports (81 and 444).

If you want to change the default ports (81 and 444) edit your all.yml and set up those two variables to different values:

```
main_port: '81'
main_ssl_port: '444'
```

To install Haproxy only, execute:

```
ansible-playbook -i environments/examples/cnx8/db2/inventory.ini playbooks/third_party/setup-haproxy.yml
```

### Setting up NFS

If you are setting up your own NFS, execute:

```
ansible-playbook -i environments/examples/cnx8/db2/inventory.ini playbooks/third_party/setup-nfs.yml
```

This will set up the NFS master, create and export needed folders for Component Pack components, and set up the clients so they can connect to it.

By default, NFS master will export the folders for its own network. If you want to change the netmask, be sure to set for example:

```
nfs_export_netmask: 255.255.0.0
```

### Setting up containerd (container runtime)

This will install containerd.io and Configure containerd.

To set it up, execute:

```
ansible-playbook -i environments/examples/cnx8/db2/inventory.ini playbooks/third_party/setup-containerd.yml
```

### Setting up Kubernetes

This will install Kubernetes, set up kubectl and Helm and make the Kubernetes cluster ready for Component Pack to be installed. However, this is really a minimum way of installing a stable Kubernetes using kubeadm. We do advice using more battle-proven solutions like kubespray or kops (or anything else) for production-ready Kubernetes clusters.

Desired kubernetes version can be set using
```
kubernetes_version
```

This set of automation will install by default 1.27.0 and should be always able to install the Kubernetes versions supported by Component Pack.

To install Kubernetes, execute:

```
ansible-playbook -i environments/examples/cnx8/db2/inventory.ini playbooks/third_party/kubernetes/setup-kubernetes.yml
```

#### Setting up kubectl for your user

If the cluster is already created, and you only want to set up kubectl for your own user, just run:

```
ansible-playbook -i environments/examples/cnx8/db2/inventory.ini playbooks/third_party/kubernetes/setup-kubectl.yml
```

### Setting up Component Pack without Haproxy

If you don't want to use Haproxy (if you simply don't need it), then you can use this playbook:

```
ansible-playbook -i environments/examples/cnx8/db2/inventory.ini playbooks/setup-component-pack-complete-development-harbor.yml
```

It will do exactly the same as playbooks/setup-component-pack-complete-harbor.yml but it will not setup Haproxy.

### Running post installation tasks

Once your Component Pack installation is done, run this playbook to set up some post installation:

```
ansible-playbook -i environments/examples/cnx8/db2/inventory.ini playbooks/hcl/connections-post-install.yml
```

## Troubleshooting

For each machine that is going to be used in any capacity with those scripts, ensure that:

* You run yum/dnf update before you start doing anything (there are multiple components that can fail installing if you don't do this)
* You have user accounts created
* DNS is properly set and reverse DNS works fine in any direction
* You have proper network and internet access where needed (no firewall issues etc)
* Machine hostnames are set properly (there are multiple components that can fail installing if this is not the case)

As a rule of thumb, be sure that:

* User that is running Ansible can SSH into all the servers mentioned inside your inventory files.
* User that is running Ansible have passwordless sudo access on all the servers mentioned inside your inventory files.
* User that is running Ansible has key forwarding enabled. Automation will try to SSH from one machine to another to execute specific tasks, run rsync etc. which can fail if key forwarding is not properly configured.
* Ansible is using Python. It *can* happen that something doesn't work as expected in your own scenario, depending on OS level, changes in distribution, etc.

If you run into a problem while running a playbook, examine the output to determine the specific command that is failing.  It is often best to try to manually run this command and to troubleshoot the specific problem before trying to run the playbook again. Based on this investigation, you'll either resolve the problem that prevented the step from completing, or you will have successfully run the command manually.  You can then run the playbook again and it will either complete the step or skip the step if no further work is needed.

# HCL Connections Docs Automation Scripts
This set of scripts is able to spin up end-to-end HCL Connections Docs on top of an existing HCL Connections deployed by the ansible scripts described above.

For HCL Connections Docs dependencies this means that:
* HCL Docs database will be created with needed user, schemas and grants.
* WebSphere application clusters will be created for each Docs components.
* WebSphere Job Manager targets will be created for Docs and Conversion nodes, Deployment Manager and Web Server.

For HCL Connections Docs itself it means:
* The script will mount NFS shares needed for the HCL Connections shared data, Docs data and Viewer data.
* HCL Docs installation kit will be downloaded.  Document Format Conversion, Editor and Viewer applications, Editor and Viewer Extensions, Editor Proxy Filter will be installed.
* IBM HTTP Server plugins will be re-generated and propagated to the web servers.
* All clusters will be started automatically at the end of the install.

## Requirements:
* HCL Connections has been installed using the Ansible script describe above.

### Have files ready for download
* See [Have files ready for download](https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/connections-automation#have-files-ready-for-download) above.

### Installing HCL Connections Docs

To install HCL Connections Docs, after adjusting your inventory files, execute:
```
ansible-playbook -i environments/examples/cnx8/db2/inventory.ini playbooks/hcl/setup-connections-docs.yml
```

### HCL Connections Docs Troubleshooting
* If HCL Connections Docs configuration adjustment is needed after the install, it can be done in `/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/Dmgr01/config/cells/${CELLNAME}/IBMDocs-config` on the WebSphere Deployment Manager.  Make sure to do a full re-synchronize to propagate any changes to all Docs nodes.
* If options are not available in HCL Connections Files to create Document/Spreadsheet/Presentation, follow Step#3 in [documentation](https://help.hcltechsw.com/docs/v2.0.1/onprem/install_guide/guide/text/functional_verification_of_installation.html) to check if the HCL Docs and File Viewer extensions are installed and active within HCL Connections. If the modules are not listed, on the HCL Connections server, go to `{{cnx_data_path_on_cnx_server}}` based on the inventory file, then go to `/provision/webresources` in that location to make sure the jars are there. Also, go to the WAS admin console to make sure `HCLDocsProxyCluster` Proxy server cluster is running.
* If you wish to re-install a HCL Connections Docs component, first cd to `/opt/HCL/<component>/installer` (`/opt/HCL/<component>/extension/installer` for Docs or Viewer extension) then run `sudo ./uninstall.sh` (`sudo ./uninstall_node.sh on subsequent nodes if exist`, ) to uninstall the component.  Delete the .success file in `/opt/HCL/<component>/` then run the playbook again.  It is recommended to comment out the prior steps in the playbook to save time.
