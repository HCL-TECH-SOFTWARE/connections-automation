# The property below - displayName - specifies that the display name is to be found in the LDAP
# attribute named 'cn', which is short for Common Name. This common mapping is intended to be used
# in the absence of utilizing the visitor model, i.e., specifying mode= below, AND decorating visitor
# names.

displayName=cn

# If visitors are being populated (by any one of the three schemes shown below) AND you wish to
# "decorate" the visitors display name, comment out the 'displayName=cn line above and un-comment
# the three properties below.
#
# The function in the first property - func_decorate_displayName_if_visitor - is provided in
# profiles_functions.js. The second property - displayNameLdapAttr - specifies the source of the
# display name in the LDAP. The value can be a function. The third attribute - decorateVisitorDisplayName -
# is the decorating text.  You should make sure that this file (the one you are looking at now) is
# in UTF-8 if non-ascii characters are used.

mode=employeeType

# mode= above is either a typical LDAP attribute or a Javascript (js) function that specifies
# whether the member is an employee or visitor.

# In all cases, the value of the LDAP attribute/js-function must be one of two strings.
# either "internal" for employees or "external" for visitors.  Actually, any string other
# than "external" is interpreted as employee.

# mode= can specify (1) a standard LDAP attribute,(2) a customer supplied js function
# that interprets one or more LDAP attributes (or anything else you can code in js - see
# the sample function in file profiles_functions.js named func_mode_from_ldap_attr()),
# or (3) the provided function func_mode_visitor_branch() when using SEPARATE LDAP BRANCHES
# to distinguish between employees and visitors.

# To populate/sync employees/visitors from a SEPARATE LDAP BRANCHES (3 above), comment out the
# line mode= above and uncomment the mode={func_mode_visitor_branch} line below.  Then, to
# populate visitors fill in the '...visitor_confirm' properties in the file profiles_tdi.properties.
# The function func_mode_visitor_branch simply uses the '...visitor_confirm' properties to
# determine a member's mode.
#
# WHEN DONE POPULATING/SYNCING A VISITOR BRANCH, you must re-set the three '...visitor_confirm'
# properties to null/empty in profiles_tdi.properties.
#
# A best practice is to use an additional solution directory for visitors.  In this way,
# you need not remember to reset the '...visitor_confirm' properties when you run sync_all_dns
# for employees, and then visitors (or vice versa).
